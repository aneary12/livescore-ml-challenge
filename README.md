# livescore-ml-challenge

ML challenge as part of LiveScore interview.

For this challenge, I was given a fictitious data set of sports betting customers, and asked to create a model which predicts if the customer will still play with us in the future.

To approach this problem, I performed some exploratory data analysis, pre-processed the data, and finally trained and tested various machine learning models.

I used Python (Jupyter Notebooks) for this challenge, mainly the Pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn libraries.

Some parameters that would have been advantageous but were not included in the data are:
- Frequency of play (how often a customer is betting).
- Total spend.
- Total loss.
- Overall balance.
- Ratio of wins:losses.
- Biggest loss.
- Betting fields (i.e. are they betting on horse racing, soccer, others, etc.).
